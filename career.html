    I know that a sudden change from "no engineering!" to "engineering!" seems
    odd and out of place, but I think it is a very logical choice for me.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have always excelled at math and science. I avoided physics because I was
    scared it would be the thing I wasn't good at, but I am taking it now and
    it is fun! Plus, engineering doesn't necessarily mean building bridges.
    There are so many fields with ways I can incorporate math, chemistry, the
    environment, computer science, or other interests I may find.
  </p>
  <p>
    I enjoyed taking Environmental Science last year, and it is a crucial field
    for maintaining our planet and sustaining human and other life. To be able
    to play a role in promoting sustainable energy and resource consumption would
    make a positive difference in the world, something I hope to do in my career.
  </p>
  <p>
    I know that college is a time for experimentation, and I may not stick with
    anything that I pick. However, I am trying to narrow down my selection to
    something that I will excel at: and I believe math-based science will be
    a good fit for me.
  </p>
  <p>
    While I was excited by the idea of teaching, I beleive it will be too
    stressful for me. There is a lot of change that I will have to cope with,
    something that is very difficult for me to do. Plus, I think that I have an
    idea of what teaching may look like based on the peers in my own classes.
    However, that is not necessarily the reality of teaching high school, and
    I believe that will add extra issues.
  </p>
  <p>
    That's not to say that I can't or won't ever be a teacher. Maybe twenty years
    from now, when I have kids, teaching will seem like the best option for me.
    It will be better for me to get experience in the field I study before I
    teach whatever I may choose to. Plus, it will be a better use of college
    time and money because I can get a teaching degree easier than I could an
    engineering degree.
  </p>
  <p>
    I will continue to explore my options and narrow down what I would like to
    do. But I believe environmental engineering will be a good way for me to
    make a solid salary and live comfortably out of college. Plus, it will give
    me a good support system for when I am ready to start my own family.
