  Growing up, computer science has always been a part of my life. My mom, my
  dad, and my stepdad all are computer scientists. My dad shared his love for
  programming with me by introducing me to Scratch and the programming language
  Basic. He encouraged me to put my ideas onto the screen—programming allowed
  me to make whatever I wanted, and now I have made a website of my own!
</p>

<p>
  Stories have been an integral part of my life. I began reading when I was
  three years old. My affinity for books did not stop with reading—I am also
  a writer. I create stories in my head and (attempt to) complete them. I
  love writing, and I hope to one day publish a book.

  As I grew older, I realized that I have autism. Though it affects how I
  handle situations in society, it does not change who I am or what I love.
  However, it can explain my obsession with cars and cats as a young child,
  and it can account for my aptitude in math and science. It also means that
  I have a difficult time adjusting to change—something that my life had an
  abundance of—and I can easily become stressed when things do not go according
  to plan. This is something that I need to consider heavily while making
  important decisions in my life: what will be best for me and my mental health?
</p>

<p>
  In my latter years of high school, I was rapidly exploring different
  opportunities and activities. I discovered a lot about myself, but I also
  spread myself thin and I lost some of what was fundamentally important to
  me. I was too busy trying to please some higher expectation of what I should
  be that I forgot who I really was.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  The fact of the matter is that I am still figuring out who I am and what I
  want to be. But I know the things that I like and the things that I have
  always excelled at. With this in mind, I will be making the decision that I
  believe to be best for me.

    I love math. I have always been advanced in it, and I have excelled. I did
    significantly better in the math section than the English section on the
    SAT, and I got 5s on all of my math-based exams my senior year—as opposed
    to the measly 3 I got on my AP Literature exam.

    Science is an intriguing field to me. It encompasses so much, and it explains
    a majority of the world and how it works. Since my dad bought me a chemistry
    kit when I was eight, I have LOVED chemistry. I couldn't wait to take it in
    high school.

    Computers have been an integral part of my life. I have been using them as
    long as I can remember, and I've been programming almost as long as that.
    There is so much I can do with them, as I am beginning to prove with this
    website. I excelled in the CS exam.

    The climate crisis is growing worse and worse by the minute. I want to be
    able to push for change and make a difference in the world. Getting involved
    in environmental change is one of the best ways to benefit our society and
    our planet.
