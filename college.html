  <p>Virginia Tech is the ideal place for me. Here are some key reasons:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Plethora of math-based courses</li>
    <li>Plenty of resources and connections to help me get a job in an engineering field</li>
    <li>Organized, rectangular campus</li>
    <li>I will be surrounded by more people like me</li>
    <li>I am friends with sophomores and juniors who can help me expand my social <circle></circle></li>
    <li>I have been going to Tech since I was little</li>
    <li>Duck pond!</li>
    <li>In the mountains (quiet!)</li>
    <li>Beautiful, peaceful drive</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I know this may not necessarily make sense. I have been against going to
    Tech for a long time for several reasons. The biggest and most important
    reason is that I desperately tried anything I could to make sure I didn't
    end up like my mom—and that meant avoiding math-based fields that I was
    so good at.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, I have said that I didn't like the size of Tech. However, UVA
    is 2/3s the size of Tech. There is still a student body of over 20,000
    undergrad. In the grand scheme of things, that's not a significant difference.
    Offsetting that further, the UVA campus is tight and cramped at times,
    whereas Tech has space to spread out, and it is logically organized in a
    rectangular pattern.
  </p>
  <p>
    For nearly all of my childhood, I was so excited to go to Virginia Tech.
    I was so against going to Virginia Tech in high school to avoid becoming
    my mother and to please my stepmom. However, with a math-related field of
    study in mind, I believe it is the best option for me.

  <p>
    I was thrilled to receive my acceptance to UVA, and I am so proud of all the
    work I have put into achieving that. However, I do not believe that it is
    the best fit for me.
  </p>
  <p>
    The primary reason is that I'm not sure it was ever what I truly wanted.
    It was the biggest and best state school, so it was the logical thing to
    push for. But I wasn't even all that drawn to it in the first place. Jenni
    told me when we were cleaning out her grandmother's apartment that she took
    me to UVA three times so that I would eventually fall in love with it—it
    was what she wanted.
  </p>
  <p>
    I tried to emulate Jenni in many ways, and that was part of me constantly
    needing to please her. I believe that is the main reason I wanted to go to
    UVA, and I was thrilled to have gotten in because it was a really difficult
    achievement. But by going to Tech, that won't be a waste of all of my hard
    work. I worked hard to get into a college, whether that be UVA or Tech, both
    of which are very respectable and good schools.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is true that UVA has a wide range of options for majors, and it does have
    an engineering school. However, the requirements to get in are difficult to
    achieve. They require up to Calc 3, which I would need to take as a Second
    Year. This will affect my plans and make it more difficult to transfer in
    and complete the requirements.
  </p>
  <p>
    I don't believe that I fit in at UVA. That's not to say that I couldn't
    find my niche, but I think Tech is much better catered to my needs. The
    Grounds are beautiful, but they are cramped. The surrounding area too much
    resembles Northern Virginia. There is traffic, and it is difficult to
    navigate. I feel uncomfortable there, and I feel trapped.

  engineering.</p>
